  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
  I was born in 1993, to a Peranakan Chinese family in Malaysia.
  When I am not building robots, I like listening to Engineering-related podcasts and bead weaving. 
  My first language is English but I am also fluent in Bahasa Malaysia (Malay). I can also speak in Mandarin.
  <br/><br/>
  I am currently working towards using robotics in combatting global warming and ensuring food security.
