Under the Engineering Good Student Chapter (EGSC) Technology Development Programme, I was part of the team tasked to design, prototype and test a system for wheelchairs to overcome the stairs in front of older HDB flats.
We worked closely with SPD to design a solution for their wheelchair-bound clients living in older public housing flats which have 2 to 4 steps leading up to their front door.


There were many challenges faced that were unique to the problem statement. Firstly, the solution had to be compact to leave sufficient clearance in accordance with the Fire Code. In addition to the safety of the system, the independence of the user was emphasized. We also considered the limited strength and flexibility of the user. Permanent modifications or additions to the wheelchair was also not feasible because it would make the wheelchair unnecessarily heavier and bulkier. Moreover, the system had to be low-cost and affordable to the users.


Thus, we proposed the use of a winch to pull up or release a rope attached to the wheelchair. The wheelchair will be guided onto a ramp, which consists of two C-channels. The ramp is positioned on top of the existing doorsteps such that the steps exposed in between the channels can still be used. To test out our prototype, we built a mock-up of the stairs using wood. Our prototype was able to ferry a wheelchair user up and down the flight of stairs safely.

This problem statement was also part of my [Global Challenge Scholars Programme (GCSP)](http://engineeringchallenges.org/GrandChallengeScholarsProgram.aspx) Portfolio.
