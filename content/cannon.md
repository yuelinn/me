This project was done during my intership at HOPE Technik Pte Ltd.
The aim of the project was to test the strength of concrete blocks at high impact. To do so, I was tasked to build a system that will project the concrete blocks at high speed. The developed system is an "air cannon" that uses pressurised air to shoot the concrete blocks out from a barrel. Specificalluy, my contribution is in conceptualizing, designing, manufacturing and testing the air cannon.
