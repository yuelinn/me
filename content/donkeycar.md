This project introduced high school students to the field of robotics through hands-on learning of electronics, Python, and Deep Learning.
The curriculum was based on the [Donkeycar project](https://www.donkeycar.com) which aims to make remote control (RC) cars autonomous. My role as a mentor in this project included the following:
+ I assembled the hardware and soldered the electronics required for the project.
+ I taught the students the implementation of the software to run the Donkeycars autonomously.
