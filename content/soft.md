This project was done during an internship under NUS with collaboration with the NUH. This project aims to develop an automated catheter to assist surgeons during non-invasive surgeries. I was tasked to develop an actuation system using soft robotics as a means of actuation for catheters used in non-invasive surgeries such as in heart operations. The robot developed had to be small to fit into the arteries of a human yet move with high precision at the command of the surgeon.
