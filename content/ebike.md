To increase awareness on electricity wastage, we simulated the generation of electricity using exercise bikes. We hope that people will realise the amount of effort required to generate the electricity that we often take for granted. As part a team of multidisplinary students working on this project, I developed the Arduino code to read the signals from the exercise bikes and the display interface using Processing language. I worked on this project while I was an on an exhange programme as an undergraduate at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).
