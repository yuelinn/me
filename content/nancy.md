Technology is almost obssed with new ideas. However, with all the cool inventions, we sometimes forget to consider how those older than us would interact with our designs. Knowing this, I started this side project for my grandmother, Nancy, who wanted to watch videos on a regular laptop. 

The main challenge came from the input interfaces of the laptop. Mouses and track pads were not intuitive and unfamiliar to the elderly. Touch screen was not available. Hence, I limited the input interface to the keyboard. The interface also had to be robust and should work immediately upon turning on the power. 

Through this project, I dabbled in programming Windows' scripts and web design (HTML and CSS). More importantly, I applied the user-centric design methodology I learned in class to approach a real problem.
