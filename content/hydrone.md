The Hydrone is an UAV developed for water environments. I was part of a multidisciplinary team of students working on this project. My main contribution is the mechanical design and fabrication of the waterproof chassis. The project was presented at Maker Faire Singapore. Our team also won the runner up at the Intel Invent 50.
