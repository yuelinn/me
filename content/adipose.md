This project was done during an internship under NUS in collaboration with Biopolis. This project aimed to assist scientists by automating the preparation of adipose tissue for stem cell extration.

The adipose tissue must be broken down into smaller pieces to optimise the yield of the extraction process. However, the cells are prone to damaged if handled too aggresively. Hence, gear-like teeth were used to break down the tissue. I was tasked to design, fabricate, and test the prototype.
