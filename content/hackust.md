While I was an on an exhange programme as an undergraduate at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), I participated in their hackathon, HackUST. During the hackathon, I joined Team FLUSH which aims to solve the excessive queuing problem at female toilets. I was the team's Coder, so I designed and developed the Android interface for the displays to indicate queues at nearby toilets.
