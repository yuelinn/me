This robot performed safety inspections in tunnels for underground trains. This was my Final-Year-Project for my undergraduate degree. The project was selected to be presented at the International Senior Project Conference 2017 in Thailand. My contributions to the project were as follows:
+ I developed the thermal image processing methods to automate the detection of leaks in train tunnels.
+ I programmed the Arduino microprocessor to interface with the gyroscope and accelerometer sensors to automate the inspection of the cross slope of the train rails.
+ I designed and fabricated mounts for the sensors onto the robotic platform.
